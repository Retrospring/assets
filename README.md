## Brand Assets

These are the brand assets commissioned by the Retrospring team in September 2022 from [Kai Kwong](https://www.kaikwong.co/), a San Jose-based designer.

## What's Included

Retrosprings brand is composed out of a symbol (the thought cloud/spring-combination) and the "Retrospring" text logomark.

For use-cases where the symbol is not able to be used, a monogram (the letter "R" of the logomark) is available as well.

**Folders:**
* `composition/`: The symbol and logomark combined
* `logo/`: The "Retrospring" logomark
* `monogram/`: The letter "R" from the logomark
* `symbol/`: The smiling thought cloud icon

Each asset is available in SVG and PNG format, and in a purple (default, no suffix), black (`blk`) or white (`wht`) variant.

The PNG exports are available in different sizes in width: `500`, `1080`, `2000` and `3500`.

## Styleguide

A styleguide that explains how (and how not to) use our branding is included in `styleguide.pdf`.

## License
