## Brand Assets

These are the brand assets commissioned by the Retrospring team in September
2022 from [Kai Kwong](https://www.kaikwong.co/), a San Jose-based designer.

## What's Included

Retrospring's brand is composed out of a symbol (the thought
cloud/spring-combination) and the _"Retrospring"_ text logo mark.

For use-cases where the symbol is not able to be used, a monogram (the letter
_"R"_ of the logo mark) is available as well.

**Folders:**
* `composition/`: The symbol and logo mark combined
* `logo/`: The _"Retrospring"_ logo mark
* `monogram/`: The letter _"R"_ from the logo mark
* `symbol/`: The smiling thought cloud icon

Each asset is available in SVG and PNG format, and in a purple (default, no
suffix), black (`blk`) or white (`wht`) variant.

The PNG exports are available in different sizes in width: `500`, `1080`,
`2000` and `3500`.

## Style guide

A style guide that explains how (and how not to) use our branding is included
in `styleguide.pdf`.

## Licence

The assets are provided by the Retrospring team to the public under
[CC-BY-4.0](./LICENCE).
